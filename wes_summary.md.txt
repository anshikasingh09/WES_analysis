## Tools Used

- FastQC: Raw read quality analysis  
- fastp: Adapter trimming and quality filtering  
- SAMtools: Alignment (BAM/SAM) file handling  
- GATK: Variant calling and filtering  
- ANNOVAR: Variant annotation with gene and disease mapping

## Folder Structure

### fastqc_reports/
Contains the HTML quality report generated by FastQC for raw FASTQ files.

### fastp_reports/
Contains the quality filtering and adapter trimming summary report generated by fastp.

### annovar_results/
Includes the final variant annotation files in .txt and .csv formats, produced using ANNOVAR.
